# Football Matches fixtures &amp; results - RESTful API Service (implemented in Node.js)

This project provides a football game service wich allows the customer clients can use to get the fixtures (upcoming
matches) and the results of football matches.

This restful api service is implemented in: http://localhost:3000/\
<br/>
The system provides 4 different methods:
<br/>
•	Get a list of matches by team
<br/>
•	Get a list of matches by team & status (played/upcoming)
<br/>
•	Get a list of matches by tournament
<br/>
•	Get a list of matches by tournament filtered by status

For this project I used to following tools:
<br/>
•	node.js
<br/>
•	csvtojson
<br/>
•	d3.js (for data filtering)
