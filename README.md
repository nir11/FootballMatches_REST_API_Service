# Football Matches fixtures &amp; results - RESTful API Service (implemented in Node.js)

This project provides a football game service which clients can use to get the fixtures (upcoming
matches) and the results of football matches.

This restful api service is implemented in: http://localhost:3000/
The system provides 4 different methods:
•	Get a list of matches by team
•	Get a list of matches by team & status (played/upcoming)
•	Get a list of matches by tournament
•	Get a list of matches by tournament filtered by status

For this project I used to following tools:
•	node.js
•	csvtojson
•	d3.js (for data filtering)
